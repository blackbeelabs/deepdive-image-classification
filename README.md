# Image Classification with Pytorch

## Introduction
Image Classification with Pytorch is a simple implementation of a deep learning project for NLP, in particular PyTorch. This project solves for image classification for MNIST


The workflow contains a couple of steps:
1. Ingestion to a local folder
2. Building a model
3. Evaluation of a model

## Setup environment
Initialise your Python environment. I use `pyenv` / `virtualenv`, and 3.10.13
```
make setup
```

## Ingest datasets
```
make ingest
```

## Train
```
make train
```

## Eval
```
make eval
```

## Remove environment
```
make remove
```
